# About
I have used following libraries pillow, tesseract, and opencv in python to build a simple search application which takes a ZIP file of images and process them so as to allow one to search through the images looking for the occurrences of keywords and faces. E.g. if you search for "Mark" it will return a contact sheet of all of the faces which were located on the newspaper page which mentions "Mark".
